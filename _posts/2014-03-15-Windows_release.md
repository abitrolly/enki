# Windows release is out

Windows release of Enki is finally out! Thanks to Bryan A. Jones, who has done the majority of work.
You can download Windows installer [here](https://github.com/andreikop/enki/releases).

Except this, release 14.03.0 contains a lot of bugfixes and improvements. I hope you'll like it.
